# Amazoom---Warehouse-Code

This repository contains the warehouse monitoring system part of the Amazoom automated system. 
There are 2 additional parts of the system - Client and Server which can be found in their own separate repositories on my main GitHub page.

This repo also contains pdf documents which ouline how the system was designed and implemented. 
Some of these documents are official UMLs such as class diagrams and sequence diagrams.
